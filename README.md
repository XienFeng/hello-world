The "Hello World" Time-Honoured Tradition for Introducing New Computer Programming Languages

Hello,

My name is Poy and I'm very interested in programming in general. I truly believe that the sky is the limit when it comes to the creativity that can flourish from this amazing field! I'm looking to further my knowledge in this field in hopes of helping others some day. However, my current technical skill can only be best described by the meme: "My code doesn't work! I don't know why... My code works! ... I don't know why..." Hopefully, I can learn lots from all of the expertise currently out there. You wonderful people, you. ;)
